# Ypto
> Project created to improve acknowledgment in object oriented programming.

The objective of this project is to improve the Ypto class provided by the documentation in the file POO - TP2.pdf.

## Getting started

This project contains the old and the new implementation.

### Legacy version

Allow to set three variables with the following methods:
 - setA(int a);
 - setB(int b);
 - setC(int c);

Allow to get three variables with the following methods:
 - getA(int a);
 - getB(int b);
 - getC(int c);

Allow to execute the following methods with the three variables:
- int sum();
- int product();

### New version

Allow to set a vector with the following method:
 - setValues(vector<int> values);

Allow to set a new value in the end of the vector with the following method:
 - setValue(int value);

Allow to update a value in the specify position of the vector with the following method:
 - updateValue(int position, int value);

Allow to get the vector values with the following method:
 - vector<int> getValues();

Allow to get the vector value in specify position with the following method:
 - int getValue(int position);

Allow to execute the following methods with the vector:
- int sum();
- int product();
